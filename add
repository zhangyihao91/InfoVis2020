\begin{abstract}
Nowadays, various countries worldwide are facing the challenge of renovating a vast amount of aging infrastructure while lacking the necessary capacities and methods to fulfill this task.
In order to assist resolving this problem, the "Global Road Damage Detection Challenge 2020" and a related data set has been proposed in the scope of the IEEE BigData 2020.
In this paper, we discuss two relevant aspects that address this problem from two distinct approaches.
The first section provides an in-depth explanation of our solution to the challenge including details of the proposed methods and the error analysis.
Subsequently, the second part presents major considerations with regard to the practical implementation of such a model to real-life conditions at low cost.
Hence, we propose a methodology aiming at road network maintenance with the purpose of providing a full service integration while optimizing the efficiency and minimizing the cost.

\section{Introduction}

In the last decade, novel machine and deep learning concepts paved the way to new frontiers in the field of computer vision with tremendous success by pushing its accuracy to a whole new level. 
Nowadays, computers are not just capable of solving simple classification problems with high success rates but have rather achieved the ability to perform tasks of visualization on a much larger scale because they are not constrained by human cognition time conditions.
This evolution in computational perception now allows the proposals of quantitative approaches to overcome certain challenges which have been impossible to solve so far due to the 'human bottleneck', e.g. cognition times, reaction times, etc.
One prominent example of such a task is autonomous driving. 
There, neural networks rapidly process ambient data of the car to assess the surrounding traffic situation and perform certain actions accordingly, leading to a safer overall road traffic.
Apart from the car industry, various economic sectors are still relying on quality assessments of certain processes by visual validation. 
Still, in most cases such visual checks are still performed by humans due to complications in the automatization of these procedures; causing a weak spot in the efficiency of the whole performance.

\
One field of application, where the visual validation of defects is an indispensable component and solely performed by humans, is infrastructure monitoring. 
As a consequence of the economic upswing in the 1960/70s, today's society is confronted with a massive amount of aging infrastructure, such as dilapidated bridges, tunnels and roads, which need to be visually checked frequently.
In 2018, Maeda et al. demonstrated the efficient investigation of road damages in a huge scale project using neural networks with smartphone images of Japanese roads with outstanding results \cite{b10}. 
In a successive project the same group successfully expanded the data acquisition to multiple countries, mainly the  Czech Republic and India, to investigate the generalization of their methods with regard to different circumstances \cite{b11}.
In order to help addressing processes of infrastructural deterioration, they generously proposed their data set to allow other researchers to face the problem using alternative approaches.

\
This paper consists of two distinct parts. 
In the first one, we are presenting our submission to the IEEE Big Data "Global Road Damage Detection Challenge 2020", providing an in-depth analysis of our methods and related errors.
In the scope of this discussion, we elucidate the methodology on improving our model accuracy by taking all kinds of attempts, positive and negative, into account, presenting the main challenges that we have encountered in the framework of this competition.
The second section proposes a possible layout plan of a full service implementation by means of the proposed model to effectively apply the concepts to real life circumstances. 
Hence, key questions and goals like the data acquisition, service architecture, graphical interface, low-cost budget trade-offs, etc. will be covered and evaluated carefully.


\section{Challenge}

\subsection{Dataset}

For this Global Road Damage Detection challenge, we use the dataset which was provided by organizers and split it by a ratio as 0.15 into two parts to training our model. One is the training dataset which include 18123 images and the other is validation dataset including 3156 images. All the images was collected from three countries which was Japen, India, Czech. In most of the images, there were several different ground truth boxs which have been labeled with the road damage classes. In the following part we will show the precision and recall of each class and country seperately.   

\subsection{Proposed method}

In the first section of our task, we used the FasterRCNN as our model to detect the image dataset. During the process of training we tried several different methods to improve our F-1 scores such as Label Smoothing, Pretraining Models, Bigger Models.In the next part we will show our results of different methods seperately.
- Show the results for different input image size: 400, 600, 800, 1000
- Show the results for different backbones: Resnet18,50,101,152. Bigger models improve accuracy.
- Show the results for label smoothing.
- Show the results for different training strategies:
  - Including data without annotations.
  - Pre-training as classification.
  - Pre-training with all classes (Improved).
  - Direct training.
Make nice plots.

\subsection{Error Analysis}

@Ryan, here is what you should talk about:
- Difference among countries:
  Japan > India > Czech. It seems proportional to the amount of data available.
- Some pattern of mistakes: D20 are very big. relatively often, the model predicts some D10 and D00 inide the D20. We could prevent these mistakes by including a kind of 
- Difference by sizes
- NMS: The model sometimes makes mistakes by recognizing 

\subsection{Failed attempts and difficulties}

Ensembling, data augmentation, etc.

\section{Service integration}

\subsection{Motivation and goals}
The following section discusses key components of a conceptual design aiming towards the implementation of the previously described model into a full-fledged service to assist infrastructure managers in monitoring and planning operations.
This objective in mind, we intend to deploy our methods on a municipality/local district of Kobe city in order to investigate its applicability and obtain a proof-of-concept for the local administrators.
During the course of realizing such a deployment, several essential questions, concerning the functionality of the project, have arisen, such as:
\begin{itemize}
\item how to efficiently collect data to exhaustively cover the target road network; 
\item how to deal with errors and uncertainties in the model output; 
\item how to integrate the extracted intelligence into existing processes to derive feasible action plans.
\end{itemize}

Considering these questions, we have needed to define a set of fundamental goals/requirements towards our system to ensure its smooth and economic implementability, for example
\begin{itemize}
\item to methodically acquire an exhaustive and accurately geo-localized imaging of the pavement of the road network;
\item to extract a multitude of geo-localized defects using our model;
\item to integrate the images and the output of the model into a GIS system for manual operators to assess errors and uncertainties;
\item to propose the generation of a proof-of-concept automatic action plan, concerning the output of the model, an objective and economic constraints;
\item to minimize the acquisition cost to make it widely accessible. 
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Service architecture}

Figure XXX illustrates the architecture of the proposed service.


\subsection{Data Acquisition}

\subsubsection{Material and Setup}

Bearing our goal of a modest acquisition cost in mind, the materials and tools, utilized for the prototypical implementation of a service, haven been chosen in accordance to cost-benefit estimates.
As a result, a RaspBerry Pi with 500GB internal data storage was used as a computing platform, controlling a PiCamera HQ camera for the data acquisition, and a GPS receiver XXX-NAME to accurately geo-localize the position at any time.
For reasons of simplicity and practicability, a personal scooter was employed as the driving vehicle whereby the camera was fixed to the front end by means of XXX. 
Each picture was taken with a resolution of XXX by XXX pixels at a recording frame rate of XXX images per second, and taking the maximum speed limit of 40 km/h of the road network into account, at least one photo was taken every XXX meters.
With these specifications, our setup allowed a continuous recording of XXX images during a time window of XXX hours before the capacity of the hard drive reached its limit. 
Furthermore, each of these pictures can be associated to a time stamp which is automatically generated in the moment of its recording. 
From the GPS receiver, a second set of XXX GPS coordinates with correlated time stamps can be obtained. 
To match both sets to each other, a linear interpolation of the image and GPS coordinate time series is performed, and based on a fairly simple calculation, the expected incertitude of XXX m of the image localization can be computed.

\subsubsection{Route planning}

In order to exhaustively and efficiently cover the target road network, the route, taken for imaging, needs to be determined precisely. 
In order to do so, we mapped our local road network as a directed graph $E$ where each crossroad is represented by a node while roads are displayed as directed edges between these nodes. 
Additionally, each edge (road segment) is linked to a corresponding cost, depending on its length.
Following this scheme, our goal of efficiently acquiring an exhaustive and accurate imaging of the road network translates into the following mathematical problem: find a path $(e1,e2)$ in $E$ that minimizes the way while assuring a full coverage of all edges.
This problem definition corresponds to the well-known Chinese postman problem [CITE], which admits a fairly simple solution: finding an Eulerian circuit that covers all edges; however, this is only possible if each node in the graph has an even degree (number of edges connected to a node). 
In order to find the minimum-cost pathway of an directed graph containing nodes with odd degrees, an expansion of additional edges between these nodes of odd degree needs to be introduced where only the combination of edges is considered whose sum is minimal and connect all nodes. 
Following this procedure an Eulerian circuit can be found.

\
We generated the directed graph based on local road network information form Open Street Map [Cite], calculated the minimum-cost pathway and applied the navigation instructions to a smartphone using the OsmAnd application for real-time navigation.
Although this approach allowed for an effective road network navigation, various major difficulties were still encountered. One issue, for example, was the imaging of multi-lane streets. 
Our setup only allowed the imaging of a single lane resulting in an inadequate depiction of some defects because of their displaced position to the camera. 
Another trouble-causing aspect was identified in the navigation scheme itself because it implies a constant driving speed on all roads and intersections, and ignores traffic conditions and traffic signals completely (traffic lights, stop signs, pedestrians, etc.).
Although we were able to compute the optimal pathway with a low-budget (free) solution, and to establish a cost-efficient tracking and imaging setup, we came to the conclusion that the navigation is still a subject of improvement or might better be offloaded to external specialized services.
